Bento
=====

Bento is a library to pack and reorder content between multiple liquid columns. 

Reasoning
---------

There're number of libraries that do it. Bento is different, because it will support liquid columns, unequal column widths and resolving content dimensions on a clientside.

It is also meant to be decoupled from presentation and may be used with node.js

How to run specs
----------------

You'll need to update submodules to fetch jasmine

    git submodule update --init 
    
And then

    open Specs/index.html
